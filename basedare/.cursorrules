# BASEDARE PROJECT DNA & RULES

## 1. THE MISSION
We are building "BaseDare" — a $20B "Social Stakes" protocol on Base L2.
Mantra: "Curated Chaos. On-Chain Trust. Instant Payouts."
Vibe: High-Fidelity Cyberpunk, Liquid Glass, Dark Matter, "The Terminal for the Creator Underworld."
Mascot: PeeBear (Glitchy, neurotic, high-voltage bear).

## 2. VISUAL LANGUAGE (The "Vibe Code")
- **Liquid Glass:** All cards/panels use `backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(180%)`, `bg-black/40`, and thin borders `border-white/10`.
- **Neon Accents:** Primary: Neon Gold (#FACC15) for Money/Honey. Secondary: Deep Purple (#A855F7) for the Void.
- **Typography:** Headings = 'Press Start 2P' (Pixel retro). Body = 'Inter' or 'Space Mono' (Clinical precision).
- **Physics:** Buttons must feel "heavy." Use `framer-motion` for spring-based interactions. No linear animations.
- **The HUD:** The UI should feel like a "Heads Up Display" overlaying a live event.

## 3. TECH STACK (The Tools)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React.
- **Web3:** Wagmi, Viem, RainbowKit (Coinbase Smart Wallet priority).
- **Backend/Verify:** Supabase (for off-chain metadata), Python/MediaPipe (for AI Referee logic).
- **Contracts:** Foundry/Hardhat, Solidity 0.8.20 (UUPS Upgradeable).

## 4. STRATEGIC PILLARS (The "Billionaire" Mindset)
- **The 10-80-10 Rule:** We automate the middle 80%. If a library exists, use it. Do not reinvent wheels.
- **Asymmetric Design:** The UI must look "expensive" to build trust. Prioritize aesthetics over code cleanliness in the prototype phase.
- **Mobile Fortress:** The layout must work on mobile, but the Desktop view is the "Command Center."

## 5. SPECIFIC COMPONENT RULES
- **Connect Wallet:** Must be a "Pill" shape with a glowing pulse indicator.
- **The Live Pot:** A 3D/Canvas orb that glitches every 45 seconds.
- **Dare Card:** The "Atomic Unit." Must feature the streamer's face, the bounty in Gold, and a "Ticking Clock."
